# Schema reference

Codes are lowercase English, exactly as each tool's schema lists them.
Say them in the person's words. Each result's `message` fields say what
to do; this file covers what the schemas do not explain.

## Dates

`YYYY-MM-DD` in the household timezone; "today" is `get_context.today`,
never your clock. Ranges are inclusive. Timestamps are ISO 8601 with
offset. Weekdays: `mon` … `sun`; entries carry their `weekday`.

## Meals

`mealType`: `breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, `snack`, `other` (name in
`label`). Some weekdays of `mealSchedule`: `update_nutrition_rules
{days}`.

## Restrictions and diets

- Restriction codes: `gluten`, `dairy`, `nuts` (tree nuts; peanuts too
  when unknown), `peanuts`, `sesame`, `fish`, `shellfish`, `soy`,
  `eggs`, `ultra-processed`, `cancer-related` (processed and cured
  meat). A member's apply at every meal they attend; the household's
  `foodRestrictions` at every meal.
- Household `selectedDiets`: `none`, `mediterranean`, `bodybuilding`,
  `keto`, `vegetarian`, `vegan`, `lowcarb`, `low-cholesterol`,
  `custom`; and `pescatarian`, `halal`, `kosher` when everyone eats so.
- A person's `diet`: `vegetarian`, `vegan`, `pescatarian`, `halal`,
  `kosher`; `dietDays` limits it to weekdays. Other rules go in their
  `notes`.
- `restrictionExceptions`: foods a person may have despite a rule.
- `update_nutrition_rules`: list items are added, `remove` takes one
  out; `selectedDiets`, `foodRestrictions`, `mealSchedule` are
  replaced whole; `"dryRun": true` previews.

## Health without a number (member fields)

Save the turn the person says it; `null` clears. General food checks,
never clinical advice.

- `pregnant: true`: foods advised against in pregnancy are flagged.
- `watch`: any of `salt`, `sugars`, `saturatedFat` (cholesterol),
  `carbs`, `iron`.
- `carbsPerMealG`: per-meal carbohydrate limit (a bread unit is 12 g).
- `strictAllergy: true`: "may contain" counts; label-dependent foods
  are flagged.
- `numbersHidden: true` (set by a coach): never say calories, grams or
  targets for that person; keep saving them.

## Food profile (`household.foodProfile`)

`weeknightMinutes`, `weekendMinutes` (see `timeLimits`; `0` = no
limit), `sharedTable` (`one-dish`/`separate-dishes`), `regularGuests`
(`name`, `weekdays`, `mealTypes?`, `restrictions?`, `diet?`, `note?`;
`[]` = nobody), `cooking`, `plannedMeals`, `pantry` (names only),
`units` (`metric`/`us`), `budget` (`tight`, `moderate`, `flexible`,
`none`), `weeklyBudget` (`{amount, currency, covers}` or `"none"`),
`equipment`, `cuisines`, `shoppingDays`, `recipeSources`
(`saved_only`, `saved_first`, `trusted_first`, `anywhere`) with
`recipeSourcesNote`, `country`, `language` (replies), `cookUnits`
(at the stove), `measures`, `onHand` (food to use up: `[{name,
where?, amount?, note?}]` or `{add, remove}`). What has no field goes
in `householdNotes`.

`update_household` also takes `setupDone`, `asked`, `onboarded`,
`datesConfirmed` and `reminderDay`. `household.reminders.email` is true only when
the weekly email is on; `eventEmail` when Droklo emails about
invitations, lists and comments.

## Plan entries

- `servings`: `null` = one per eater; a number = portions cooked; `0` =
  leftovers (keep `recipeId`).
- `additions`: up to 8 `{name, grams, memberIds}`. `guests`: up to 12
  `{name, restrictions?, diet?, note?}`. `cookMemberId`.
- `nutrition` (`caloriesKcal`, `proteinG`, `carbsG`, `fatG` per
  serving): for a meal without a recipe; an estimate.
- `status: "draft"` is a coach's proposal: on no list and in no total
  until accepted (`accept_proposals`).
- Each entry's `recipe` has `prepTimeMin`, `cookingTimeMin`,
  `totalTimeMin`: quote these.

## Plan checks (`planChecks[]`)
Act on each `message`; usual fixes are in planning-workflow.md, step 6.
A food a person may in fact have: `restrictionExceptions`.
`dates_unconfirmed`: ask the dates question.

## Nutrition fields

Recipe `nutritionPerPortion` + `nutritionEstimated`. Log `nutrition`
(totals eaten) + `estimated`. Member `targets`: `dailyCaloriesKcal`,
`dailyProteinG`, `dailyFatG`, `dailyCarbsG`; `trainingDays` with
`trainingTargets` replace them on those days.

## Logs, ratings, comments

- `rating`: `liked`, `neutral`, `disliked` (`rate_recipe`: liked or
  disliked). `feeling`: `great`, `ok`, `heavy`, `bloated`,
  `still-hungry`, `low-energy`. `reading`: `{kind, value, unit,
  timing?}`, stored, never interpreted.
- Comment `target.type`: `planEntry`, `mealLog`, `recipe` (with `id`),
  `day` (with `date`), `general`. `kind`: `comment` or `question`.
  Replies use `parentId`.
- `notices`: `proposal` (with `batchId`), `targets`, or `team` (the
  Droklo team answered this person's feedback; with `feedbackId`);
  `mark_read` takes the notice `id`.
- Feedback to the Droklo team (`send_feedback`): `kind` `problem`,
  `idea`, `praise`, `rating`, `reply`; `rating` `good`, `okay`, `bad`;
  `replies` `here`, `email`, `none`. An `INTERNAL` error carries `ref`.

## Limits and call shape

- `add_plan_entries` up to 50 entries; `delete_plan_entries` 100 ids;
  `search_recipes` `limit` 50 with `offset`; date ranges 366 days
  (coach tools 92).
- Arguments are flat except `save_recipe {recipe}` and
  `update_nutrition_rules {patch}`. Unknown keys fail with `INVALID`.
  On updates `null` clears.
- Errors: `NOT_A_MEMBER`, `FORBIDDEN`, `LOCKED`, `NOT_FOUND`,
  `INVALID`, `INTERNAL`: do what the `message` says.
