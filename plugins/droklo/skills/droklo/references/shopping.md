# Shopping

A list covers a date range. Droklo computes it from planned meals with
a recipe (eaters, guests, `servings`, `additions`) and keeps manual
items and ticks. Leftovers entries and unaccepted proposals add
nothing. Active lists follow the plan and sync with the web app.

## One list per shop

- Make it in the same turn as a plan of several days; offer it after
  one meal. Range: first meal the shop feeds to the day before the next
  shop. Name it after the shop; say when to shop from the stored
  shopping days, never an invented deadline.
- Never a second list over dates an active list covers: use it, or
  move it with `rename_shopping_list {"listId", "from", "to"}` (keeps
  ticks). A completed or ticked list is never stretched: make a new
  one (`no_shopping_list` says which).
- `completedLists`: say in one line which older lists were finished.
- Several active lists: pick by date range (`activeLists`); ask only
  if two still fit.
- Lines with `boughtOn` are bought: never offer or ask about them.
- `"compact": true` when you only show or tick.

## Read the result

```
create_shopping_list {"from": "2026-11-13", "to": "2026-11-15", "name": "Weekend shop"}
```

- `quantity` is the pack to buy: show as is. `needed` is what the
  recipes use: quote it when asked how much a dish takes, or for
  someone who wants grams.
- `list.summary` is the count you say, from the latest result.
- `list.countedFor`: what the list is for and for how many.
- `notOnList`: link a recipe, add the items by hand, or say which meals
  they shop for themselves. Never call the list complete otherwise.
- A planned meal with a recipe goes on a list through the meal, never
  by typing its ingredients: when a plan result says it is on no list
  (`no_shopping_list`), stretch the list (`rename_shopping_list`) or
  make one. If you typed a planned meal's foods anyway, Droklo puts the
  meal on the list itself and returns `forMeals`: say its `say`.
- A completed list is the record of a shop. Never re-date or refresh
  it; for days it does not cover, make a new list.
- `planChecks` (`fresh_early`): do what it says.
- `oneMeal`: lines bought for one meal. When money is tight, offer to
  swap that meal. Never call it a saving in money.
- `ask.questions`: the one question, as worded, in the reply that
  hands over the list (`askLater`: waits or is dropped). Then one call:

```
update_shopping_items {"listId": "sl_weekend",
  "pantry": "allLikelyAtHome", "except": ["paprika"]}
```

  Field absent: ask nothing about staples. Someone who does not know
  their cupboard: `"unsure"` (names, ids or `"allLikelyAtHome"`).
- `list.atHome`: not to buy, not counted or costed. Close with its
  `check` line. Droklo knows names, not stock.
- "We're out of oil": `"ranOut": ["olive oil"]` that turn. `noLine`: no
  planned meal needs it; offer to add it by hand.
- `pantryHint` after ticking: ticks hold for this list only; "always
  have these" is `pantry`.

Yours to add: the deciding words in the item name ("gluten-free
tamari", "halal chicken") and, for an allergy, coeliac disease or a
religious rule, one line naming every item whose label matters.

**Stores and days:** `"where": [{"label": "Market", "ids": […]}]`
(`null` clears). Use it when they name two stores or days; group by it.

**Show it short:** by aisle, amounts as given. Long list:
`summary`, the link, the few items worth a remark. Paste only from
`export_shopping_list`.

**Paper and people without a login:** `"format": "print"` for paper
(give the text itself to someone who cannot print), `"format": "text"`
for a message. People in `readers.withoutLogin` get the text, never the
link.

Once they left with a list, later additions go in a new list. A remade
list: say the old link is dead.

## Change items

`update_shopping_items` takes every op in one call:

```
update_shopping_items {"listId": "sl_weekend",
  "add": [{"name": "Milk", "quantityText": "2 l", "category": "dairy"}],
  "update": [{"id": "si_rice", "patch": {"quantityText": "1 kg"}}],
  "remove": ["si_ghee"], "check": ["si_eggs"]}
```

- "I bought the milk": match names to ids; ask if several match.
  "Take off the ghee": `remove` by id, then confirm from `changed`.
- A tick means bought: in the basket, paid for or ordered. Shop done or order placed: `set_shopping_list_status {"status": "completed",
  "checkAll": true}`, or `update_shopping_items {"checkAll": true,
  "uncheck": [what the store lacked]}`. Delivery came short: untick
  what did not come. `undo` puts ticks back.
- Hand edits survive refreshes (`edited`). Removed lines stay off until
  a new meal needs them (`changes.keptOff`): say so.
- On an error nothing was applied: fix and resend the whole call.

## When the plan changes

Plan tools refresh the lists themselves (`shoppingLists`). Relay `say` with the `url`. Name each `recheck` item as `say` words it. Call
`refresh_shopping_list` only when a planned recipe or a member changed;
rewrite `changes.reword` lines. Never re-buy after shopping: ticked
and `boughtOn` lines are bought.

## The shop did not happen

No blame, no why. Ask one question: when the next shop is. Offer to
move the meals before it (`move_plan_entry` only to days they agree;
act on `dependents`, `notesToReview`), then re-date the list to its
meals' days, never the shop day. Save the home-food meal they take
for tonight; give the link. Part bought: tick it first.
`shop.state: "unknown"`: follow `shop.say`.

## Budget

Droklo knows no prices. It keeps `foodProfile.weeklyBudget` and your
estimate, and says when the estimate is over.

1. Estimate the to-buy items from usual prices where they shop.
2. `set_shopping_list_estimate {"listId", "amount": 135, "currency":
   "EUR", "note": "Rough guess; fish and beef are a third."}`.
3. Say it as a guess with what it covers: "about 135 for the six
   dinners; I can't see prices."
4. `budget.overBudget: true`: say `overBy` and offer the two or three
   swaps that save most; after a yes change the plan and re-estimate.
   Otherwise say what is `left` for what else the budget covers. "Within
   budget" only when the figure covers everything the budget pays for.

Real total: `{"listId", "actual": 142}`; it anchors the next guess. "No
set budget": save `"weeklyBudget": "none"`. Only a level (`"tight"`):
name the costliest items and a cheaper swap each; do not ask for an
amount twice.

## Units

`foodProfile.units: "us"` shows ounces, pounds, quarts: set it when
someone asks for pounds or cups.

## Finish, rename, delete

`set_shopping_list_status`: `changed: null` = already so.
`delete_shopping_list`: ask first, suggest archiving.

## Hand off to a store
Only with a grocery service's tools: unticked, non-pantry items without
`boughtOn`, products that fit restrictions. Never order or pay without
the person confirming in the store's flow. No connector: give the export.
